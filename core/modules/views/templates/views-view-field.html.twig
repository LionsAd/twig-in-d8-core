/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation for a single field in a view.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - view: The view object.
 * - field: The field handler object that can process the input.
 * - row: The raw SQL result that can be used.
 * - output: The processed output that will normally be used.
 *
 * When fetching output from the row, this construct should be used:
 * data = row[field.field_alias]
 *
 * The above will guarantee that you'll always get the correct data,
 * regardless of any changes in the aliasing that might happen if
 * the view is modified.
