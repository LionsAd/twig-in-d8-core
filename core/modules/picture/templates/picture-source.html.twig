/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to display a picture source tag.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the source tag, including:
 *   - media: The media query to use.
 *   - width: The width of the image (if known).
 *   - height: The width of the image (if known).
 *   One of the following two attributes will also be set:
 *   - src: Either the path of the image file (relative to base_path()) or a
 *     full URL.
 *   - srcset: A group of image sources/resolutions used to display different
 *     image resolutions at different breakpoints.
 * - attributes_copy: A copy of the 'attributes' variable to allow for printing
 *   the attributes a second time for the commented source tags. Drupal's
 *   Attribute object keeps track of which attributes have been printed and will
 *   only print an attribute once.
